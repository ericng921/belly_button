# belly_button
## Overview of analysis

We are identifying the top 10 bacterial species in their belly buttons.That way, if Improbable Beef identifies a species as a candidate to manufacture synthetic beef, we will be able to identify whether that species is found in their navel.

We created 3 different charts for our analysis.
