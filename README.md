# belly_button
## Overview of analysis

We are identifying the top 10 bacterial species in their belly buttons.That way, if Improbable Beef identifies a species as a candidate to manufacture synthetic beef, we will be able to identify whether that species is found in their navel.

We created 3 different charts for our analysis.


## Result



As the picture shown above, it is the main page of the analysis.




Other than "Make the webpage mobile-responsive" which is already default from the starter code, there are three more customerization for the webpage:

1. Add an image to the jumbotron;

2. Add more information about the project as a paragraph on the page.

3. Use a custom font with contrast for the colors.
